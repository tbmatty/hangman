Some people might say that I'm not taking this README seriously, to those people I say... Preposterous! I would never do such a thing as to not take a README seriously and I will fight any man who dares challenge me on this fact. Indubitably, this is a most esteemed and respected README of class and calibre.

The Hangman class takes two paramaters for its constructor - num_lives and word_list
You can run the Hangman class by creating a Hangman object and running ask_for_input
